About me
======
I am currently working in the Department of Mathematics at Jinan (Êö®Âçó) University in Guangzhou, China. I got my PhD in applied mathematics at Sun Yat-sen University in 2022. My research focuses on developing advanced **non-i.i.d.-oriented machine learning algorithms** for heterogeneous biomedical data, including multi-omics and single-cell data, as well as histopathological images.
